# IMPLEMENT SIMPLE JPEG2000 IMAGE COMPRESSION ALGORITHM

This project implements a simplified version of the JPEG2000 image compression standard using Python. JPEG2000 is a wavelet-based image compression standard that offers superior compression efficiency and image quality compared to traditional JPEG, especially at higher compression ratios. 

The implementation focuses on the core components of JPEG2000:
- Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for image decomposition
- Coefficient quantization
- Entropy coding for data compression
- Proper handling of color (RGB) images
